# What is Stardust

Stardust is a globally distributed database which is _resource-constrained_. Specifically, Stardust is built such that the resource consumption of any datacenter within its system can be optimized to remain within a bounded resource constraint (as best as it is able, at least).

The original motivation to explore the concept of Stardust was to ask the question: "Is it possible to run a modern, reliable database using only solar power and batteries?". Stardust is our attempt to answer that question, and to work out the consequences of external resource constraints on cloud-based database development.

### Scott Fines
I have worked in distributed systems for 16 years, and more than 10 of them have been spent designing transactional systems. I have worked at various startups around the USA, as well as Apple and running my own company (briefly, until it ran out of funding). I am interested in the intersection of energy, the environment, and computer science.
